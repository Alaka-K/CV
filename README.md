After taking a hiatus from radiography and while during my travels I stumbled across coding and I haven't been able to stop since!

 I was really inspired by the fact that the tech industry intersects with nearly every other industry allowing software developers to work in various fields. My passion for learning new things and desiring a career that challenges me led me to a career switch.
 
 I've graduated as a Full Stack Junior Developer. I'm eager to advance my knowledge and skills as a developer. I would love the opportunity to be part of a friendly and supportive team where I can enhance my skills and contribute to amazing and innovative projects.

## Skills
### Teamwork

Teamwork is an integral part of working as a radiographer. For the majority of areas we work in, multiple radiographers are required to provide an efficient service. Working in arears such as CT and MRI, two to three radiographers are assigned to a scanner, we would then collectively plan our workflow. Our individual roles are reliant on one another, this has led me to gain clear communication skills and allowed me to work comfortably with a range of people.
This ability to work effectively within a team proved extremely helpful while on the Makers bootcamp. We paired with other programmers on a daily basis as well as working collaboratively in group projects.

### Motivated

I'm a highly motivated individual that is eager to accomplish my goals. As a junior radiographer I had a desire to learn as much as possible to better develop my skills and make me a versatile radiographer. This pursuit led me to voluntarily train as a PAC radiographer and as one of the key radiographer to work autonomously within the designated fluoroscopic room.
Since completing the Makers bootcamp, I've enrolled onto the CS50 Introduction to computer science course as well as signed up to group coding sessions run by [**Ladies of Code**](https://www.ladiesofcode.com/)
### Problem solving
As part of my role as a PAC's radiographer I regularly had to solve issues pertaining to missing images. On one occasion, a radiologist notified me that there were images that required urgent reporting, however the examination was completed without any images being present in the patients folder. I had to use a systemic approach to investigate why the examination was document as completed but there were no images.
During my time at Makers, I had to apply those problem solving skills to the different challenges. We learnt early on at Makers to deconstructing problems into smaller parts, and focus on that challenge before moving on. A new concept that I learnt which really aided my problem solving skills was debugging. We learnt various techniques which helped me determinate errors that weren’t immediately apparent.

## Experience

**Charing Cross hospital** (April 2017 - September 2019)  
_Senior Radiographer_

- Direct and supervise the workload of junior members of staff in areas such CT, Theatres and general x-ray.
- Collaborate effectively within a multidisciplinary team to deliver a high standard of care. 

**Charing Cross hospital** (November 2015 - March 2017)  
_Junior Radiographer_

- Provide high level of care to patients by examining requests and the patients condition to see if requests are justified. 
- Supervise the practice and assess the progress of students, ensuring that professional standards are developed and attained.
- Operate autonomously when providing an out of hour’s service to patients requiring urgent imaging due to acute trauma or illness. 

## Hobbies

In my free time I’m keen to maintain and develop my Arabic by teaching it on a basic level to children and adults.
