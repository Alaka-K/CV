## Kehinde Alaka

After taking an hiatus from radiography and while during my travels I stumbled across coding and I haven't been able to stop since!

 I was inspired to work in the tech industry as it is extremely versatile and constantly changing. The tech industry is a thriving sector that intersects with nearly every other industry allowing software developers to work in various fields. My passion for learning new things and desiring a career that challenges me led me to a career switch. I was fortunate to be accepted onto the Makers Academy skills bootcamp.

16 intensive weeks later, I've graduated as a Full Stack Junior Developer. I'm eager to advance my knowledge and skills as a developer. I would love the opportunity to be part of a friendly and supportive team where I can enhance my skills and contribute to amazing and innovative projects.

## Work Experience

**Charing Cross hospital** (April 2017 - September 2019)  
_Senior Radiographer_

- Direct and supervise the workload and junior members of staff in areas such CT, Theatres and general x-ray.
- Work effectively within a multidisciplinary team to deliver a high standard of care. 

**Charing Cross hospital** (November 2015 - March 2017)  
_Junior Radiographer_

- Provide high level of care to patients by examining requests and the patients condition to see if requests are justified. 
- Supervise the practice and assess the progress of students, ensuring that professional standards are developed and attained.
- Operate autonomously when providing an out of hour’s service to patients requiring urgent imaging due to acute trauma or illness. 
## Skills
### Teamwork

Teamwork is an integral part of working as a radiographer. For the majority of areas we work in, multiple radiographers are required to provide an efficient service. Working in arears such as CT and MRI, two to three radiographers are assigned to a scanner, we would then collectively plan our workflow. Our individual roles are reliant on one another, this has led me to gain clear communication skills and allowed me to work comfortable with a range of people.
This ability to work effectively within a team proved extremely helpful while on the Makers bootcamp. We paired with other programmers on a daily basis as well as working collaboratively in group projects.

### Motivated

I'm a highly motivated individual that is eager to accomplish my goals. As a junior radiographer I had a desire to learn as much as possible to better develop my skills and make me a versatile radiographer. This pursuit led me to voluntarily train as a PAC radiographer and as one of the key radiographer to work autonomously within the designated fluoroscopic room.
Since completing the Makers bootcamp, I've enrolled onto the CS50 Introduction to computer science course as well as signed up to group coding sessions run by [**Ladies of Code**](https://www.ladiesofcode.com/)
